              <li><p>Father, in the name of Jesus, we confess Your Word concerning healing.  As we do this, we believe and say that Your Word will not return to You void, but will accomplish what is says it will.  Therefore, we believe in the Name of Jesus that _______________is healed according to I Peter 2:24.  It is written in Your Word that Jesus Himself took his infirmities and bore his sicknesses. (Matthew 8:17)  Therefore, with great boldness and confidence we say on the authority of that written Word that _______________is redeemed from the cures of sickness and _______________ refuses to tolerate its symptoms.</p></li>
              <li><p>SATAN, WE SPEAK TO YOU IN THE NAME OF JESUS AND SAY THAT YOUR PRINCIPALITIES, POWERS, YOUR MASTER SPIRITS WHO RULE THE PRESENT DARKNESS, AND YOUR SPIRITUAL WICKEDNESS IN HEAVENLY PLACES ARE BOUND FROM OPERATING AGAINST _______________ IN ANY WAY.  _______________ IS LOOSED FROM YOUR ASSIGNMENT.  _______________ IS THE PROPERTY OF ALMIGHTY GOD AND WE GIVE YOU NO PLACE _______________. _______________DWELLS IN THE SECRET PLACE OF THE MOST HIGH GOD; _______________ ABIDES, REMAINS STABLE AND FIXED UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE ALMIGHTY, WHOSE POWER NO FOE CAN WITHSTAND.</p></li>
              <li><p>Now, Father, because we reverence and worship You, we have the assurance of Your Word that the angel of the Lord encamps around about _______________ and delivers _______________ from every evil work.  No evil shall befall _______________, no plague or calamity shall come near his dwelling.  We confess the Word of God abides in _______________ and delivers to him perfect soundness on mind and wholeness in body and spirit.</p></li>
              <li><p><em>Once this has been prayed, thank the Father that Satan is bound and continue to confess this healing and thank God for it.</em></p</li>

                <li><p>I am of God and have overcome him (satan).  For greater is He that is in me, than he that is in the world. (I John 4:4)</p></li>
                <li><p>I will fear no evil for You are with me Lord, Your Word and Your Spirit they comfort me. (Psalm 23:4)</p></li>
                <li><p>I am for from oppression, fear does not come near me. (Isaiah 54:14)</p></li>
                <li><p>No weapon formed against me shall prosper, for my righteousness is of the Lord.  But whatever I do will prosper for I'm like a tree that is planted by the rivers of water. (Isaiah 54:17; Psalm 1:3)</p></li>
                <li><p>I am deliverance from the evils of this present world for it is the will of God. (Galatians 1:4)</p></li>
                <li><p>No evil will befall me neither will any plague come near my dwelling.  For the Lord has given His angels charge over me and they keep me in all my ways.  And in the pathway is life and there is no death. (Pslams 91:10-11; Proverbs 12:28)</p></li>
                <li><p>I am a doer of the Word of God and I am blessed in my deeds.  I am happy in those things which I do because I am a doer of the Word of God. (James 1:22)</p></li>

                <li><p><em>"Give attention to My words ... for they are life ... and health (medicine) to all their flesh"</em> (Proverbs 4:20-22)</p></li>
                <li><p>God's Word ministers to the total man.  His Word (Jesus) is our wisdom, righteousness, sanctification and redemption.</p></li>
                <li><p>Most people have used the words of their mouth to hold themselves in bondage.  But as you begin to speak the Word of God from the heart, it will produce liberty.  It will produce the health and healing the Word said it would.</p></li>
                <li><p>Most people have spoken contrary to the Word.  They have spoken things that the devil has said.  The have quoted what the enemy has said about them.  Therefore, they have established on Earth the words the enemy has said.</p></li>
                <li><p>If we will begin to establish the things God said, and establish His Word on this earth, then thank God!  We will rise to a new <em>level of Faith.</em></p></li>
               <li><p>We will walk in the level of life where we release the ability of God <em>by the words of our mouth</em>.  We can release the ability of God within ourselves by the words of our mouth and cause His Word and His power to become available to us.</p></li>

                    <li><p>Heavenly Father, thank You for being our Healer, our Jehovah Rophe (Exodus 15:26).  I declare that You are our health, healing, and soundness in and over us.  We have the healing of God, for by Your stipes, we were healed (I Peter 2:24).  We have spiritual healing, soulish healing, physical healing, and healing in relationships for we have been redeemed from the curese of the law (Galatians 3:13).  We have been redeemed from sickness, poverty, and spiritual death (Deuteronomy 28:2-13).  We have the health of God.  We have Your soundness in our spirits, souls, and bodies.  We present our bodies as living sacrifices, holy and acceptable to You, which is our reasonable service.  We are not conformed to this world, but we are transformed by the renewing of our minds to Your Word (Romans 12:1-2).  Lord, You are on our side.  We fear no man (Psalms 118:6).  We are overcomers.  We overcame all strongholds and bondages by the Blood of the Lamb, which cleanses us from all unrighteousness (I John 1:9) and the word of our testimony which is Your Word that we have hidden in our hearts to keep us from returning to those strongholds (Psalms 119:11) and we love not our life unto death (Revelation 12:11).</p></li>
