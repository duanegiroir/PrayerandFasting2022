        <p>"I sought the Lord and He answered me and delivered me from all my fears. Those who look to him are radiant, and their faces shall never be ashamed." (Psalm 34:4-5, ESV)</p>

      <div class="content-text">
        <p><span></span></p>
        <p>The Bible is filled with references to the prayers and fasting of His people.  In Matthew 6, Jesus placed fasting on the same level as praying and giving.  He said, "When you fast, when you pray, and when you give."  I wonder why Christians today and churches in our generation don't place fasting on the same level as praying and giving?</p>
        <p><span></span></p>
        <p>Jesus, by example and His teaching, demonstrates that prayer and fasting are important and integral ingredients in the lives of His followers.  One purpose of prayer and fasting is to bring our hearts to a place of being filled with a sacrificial love that results in godly attitudes in our lives.  True fasting will draw us closer to God and His purposes.</p>
        <p><span></span></p>
        <p>I can't explain why God has chosen Prayer and Fasting as the gateway to supernatural power.  One thing I do know: scripture, prayer, and fasting are the ways believers humble themselves in the sight of the Lord.  When we humble ourselves, He promises to exalt and lift us up at the appointed time (1 Peter 5:6, James 4:10)  God also indicates that He will give grace to the humble (James 4:6).  Again II Chronicles 7:14 indicates that importance of humbling ourselves before God.</p>
        <p><span></span></p>
        <p>Fasting brings a sharp focus to the dramatic difference between our physical and spiritual natures.  Eating is one of the most fundamental things we do as physical beings.  One of the most natural desires in for food.  Without proper nourishment we die.  By exercising our wills and depriving ourselves of food for spiritual purposes, we acknowledge our spiritual natures and honor our Creator-Father.  When we deny the natural for the purpose of calling upon God to do the supernatural, He will enable and empower us to experience the supernatural.</p>
        <p><span></span></p>
        <p>Through fasting, we confirm the words uttered by Jesus in the face of temptation during his forty-day fast, "Man does not live by bread alone, but by every Word that proceeds from the mouth of God" (Matthew 4:4).  Through prayer and fasting we forsake our own physical needs and the creature comforts of this world and call upon God as the Originator, Giver, Source, and Sustainer of all life, especially our own.  We exalt His as our hope and salvation.  True spiritual fasting will result in submission and devotion to God.</p>
