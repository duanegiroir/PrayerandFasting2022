        <h2 class="content-title">Prayer for the Body of Christ</h2>
        <div class="content-text">
          <ul>
           <li><p>Father, we pray and confess your Word over the Body of Christ.  We pray that Your people be filled with the full, deep, and clear knowledge of Your will in all spiritual things.  We pray they live and conduct themselves in a manner worthy of You, Lord, fully pleasing to You and desiring to please You in all things, bearing fruit in every good work, and steadily growing and increasing in and by the knowledge of you, with fuller, deeper, and clearer insight. </p></li>
           <p><span></span></p>
           <li><p>We pray that the Body of Christ well be invigorated and strengthened with all power, according to the might of Your glory, to exercise every kind of endurance and patience with joy, giving thanks to You, Father; Who has qualified and made them fit to share the portion which is the inheritance of the saints (God's holy people) in the Light.  You, Father, have delivered and drawn them to Yourself out of the control and the dominion of darkness and have transferred them into the Kingdom of the Son of Your love, in Whom they have their redemption through His blood, which means the remission of their sins.</p></li>
           <p><span></span></p>
           <li><p>Father, You delight at the sight of the Body of Christ, standing shoulder to shoulder and the firmness and the solid front and steadfastness of their faith in Christ, leaning on Him in absolute trust and confidence in His power, wisdom, and goodness.  They have the roots of their being firmly and deeply planted in Him, being continually built up in Him, becoming increasingly more confirmed and established in the faith.</p></li>
           <p><span></span></p>
           <li><p>Your people, Father, clothe themselves as Your own picked representatives - Your chosen ones, who are purified and holy and well-beloved by You.  Then have the power to endure whatever comes with good temper.  They are gentle and forbearing with each other and, if they have a grievance or complaint against another readily pardon each other.  As You, Lord, have freely forgiven them, so do they also forgive.</p></li>
           <p><span></span></p>
           <li><p>Your people put on love.  They let peace from Jesus act as umpire continually in their hearts - deciding and settling with all finality all the questions that arise in their minds - in that peaceful state to which they are called.  They are thankful, appreciative, giving praise to You always.</p></li>

          <ul>
            <li><p>Father, in the name of Jesus, we come before You in prayer and in faith, believing.  It is written in Your Word that Jesus came to save the lost.  You wish all men to be saved and to know Your Divine Truth.  Therefore, Father, we bring ___________________ before You this day.</p></li>
            <p><span></span></p>

            <p><span></span></p>
            <li><p>Father, we ask the Lord of the harvest to thrust the perfect laborer into his (her) path, a laborer to share Your Gospel in a special way so that he will listen and understand it.  As Your laborer ministers to him, we believe that he will come to his senses ... come out of the snare of the devil that's held him captive and make Jesus the Lord of his life.</p></li>
            <p><span></span></p>
            <li><p>Your Word says that You will deliver those for whom we intercede, who are not innocent, through the cleanness of our hands.  We're standing on Your Word and from this moment on, Father, we shall praise You and Thank You for his (her) salavation.  We have committed this matter into Your hands and with our faith we see ___________________ saved, filled with Your Spirit, with a full and clear knowledge of Your Word.  AMEN - SO BE IT!</p></li>
