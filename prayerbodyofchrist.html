        <div class="content-text">
          <ul>
           <li><p>Father, we pray and confess your Word over the Body of Christ.  We pray that Your people be filled with the full, deep, and clear knowledge of Your weill in all spiritual things.  We pray they live and conduct themselves in a manner worthy of You, Lord, fully pleasing to You and desiring to please You in all things, bearing fruit in every good work, and steadily growing and incresing in and by the knowledge of you, with fuller, deeper, and clearer insight. </p></li>
           <li><p>We pray that the Body of Christ well be invigorated and strengthened with all power, according to the might of Your glory, to exercise every knod of endurance and patience with joy, giving thanks to You, Father; Who has quilified and made them fit to share the portion which is the inheritance of the saints (God's holy people) in the Light.  You, Father, have delivered and drawn them to Yourself out of the control and the dominion of darkness and have transferred them into the Kingdom of the Son of Your love, in Whom they have their redemption through His blood, which means the remission of their sins.</p></li>
           <li><p>Father, You delight at the sight of the Body of Christ, standing shoulder to shoulder and the firmness adn the solid fromt and steadfastness of their faith in Christ, leaning on Him in absolute trust and confidence in His power, wisdom, and goodness.  They have the roots of their being firmly adn deeply planted in Him, being continually built up in Him, becoming increasingly more confirmed and established in the faith.</p></li>
           <li><p>Your people, Father, clothe themselves as Your own picked representatives - Your chosen ones, who are purified and holy and well-beloved by You.  Then have the power to endure whatever comes with good temper.  They are gentle and forbearing with each other and, if they have a grievance or complaint against another readily pardon each other.  As You , Lord, have freely forgiven them, so do they also forgive.</p></li>
           <li><p>Your people put on love.  they let peace from Jesus act as umpire continually in their hearts - deciding and settling with all finality allthe questions that arise in their minds - in theat peaceful state to which they are called.  They are thankful, appreciative, giving praise to You always.</p></li>

        <div class="content-text">
          <ul>
            <li><p>Father, in the name of Jesus, we come before You in prayer and in faith, believing.  It is written in Your Word that Jesus came to save the lost.  You wish all men to be saved and to know Your Divine Truth.  Therefore, Father, we bring ___________________ before You this day.</p></li>
            <li><h4>SATAN, WE BIND YOU IN THE NAME OF JESUS AND LOOSE YOU FROM THE ACTIVITIES IN ____________________'S LIFE!</h4></li>
            <li><p>Father, we ask the Lord of the harvest to thrust the perfect laborer into his (her) path, a laborer to share Your Gospel ina special way so that he will listen and understand it.  As Your laborer ministers to him, we believe that he will come to his senses ... come out of the smare of the devil that's held him captive and make Jesus the Lord of his life.</p></li>
            <li><p>Your Word says that You will deliver those for whom we intercede, who are not innocent, through the cleanness of our hands.  We're standing on Your Word and from this moment on, Father, we shall praise You and Thank You for his (her) salavation.  We have committed this matter into Your hands and with our faith we see ___________________ saved, filled with Your Spirit, with a full adn clear knowledge of Your Word.  AMEN - SO BE IT!</p></li>
            <li><h5>Each day after praying this prayer, thank the Lord for this person's salavation.  Rejoice and praise God for the victory!  Confess the above prayer as done!  Thank Him for sending the laborer.  Thank Him that Satan is bound.  Hallelujah!</h5></li>
