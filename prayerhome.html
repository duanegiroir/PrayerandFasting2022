            <ul>
              <li><p>Father, in the name of Jesus, I pray and confess Your Word over my children and surround them with my faith - faith in Your word that You watch over it to perform it!  I confess and believe that my children are disciples of Christ, taught of the Lord and obedient to Your will.  Great is the peace and undisturbed composure of my children...because You, God, contend with that which contends with my children and You give them safety and ease them.</p></li>
              <p><span></span></p>
              <li><p>Father, you will perfect that which concerns me.  I commit and cast the care of my children once and for all over on you, Father.  They are in your hands.  I am positively persuaded that You are able to guard and keep that which I have committed to You.  You are more than enough!</p></li>
              <p><span></span></p>
              <li><p>I believe and confess that You give Your angels charge over my children to accompany and defend and preserve them in all their ways.  You, Lord, are their refuge and fortress.  You are their glory and the lifter of their heads.</p></li>
              <p><span></span></p>
              <li><p>As parents, we will not provoke, irritate, or fret our children.  WE will not be hard on them or harass them, or cause them to become discouraged, sullen, morose and feel inferior and frustrated.  We will not break or wound their spirit, but we will rear them tenderly in the training, discipline, counsel, and admonition of the Lord.  We will train them in the way they should go and when they are old they will not depart from it.</p></li>

              <li><p>Father, in the name of Jesus, it's written in Your Word that love is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost Who is given to us.  Because You are in us, we acknowledge that love reigns supreme.  We believe that love is displayed in full expression, enfolding and knitting us together in truth, making us perfect for every good work to do Your will, working in us that which is pleasing in Your sight.</p></li>
              <p><span></span></p>
              <li><p>We live and conduct ourselves and our marriage honorably and becomingly.  We esteem it as precious, worthy and of great price.  We commit ourselves to live in mutual harmony and accord with one another delighting in each other, being of the same mind and united in spirit.</p></li>
              <p><span></span></p>
              <li><p>Father, we believe and say that we are gentle, compassionate, courteous, tender-hearted and humble-minded.  We seek peace and it keeps our hearts in quietness and assurance.  Because we follow after love and dwell in peace, our prayers are not hindered in any way, in the name of Jesus.  We are heirs together of the grace of God.</p></li>
              <p><span></span></p>
              <li><p>Our marriage grows stronger day by day in the bond of unity because it is founded on Your Word and rooted and grounded in Your love.  Father, we thank You for the performance of it, in Jesus' name.</p></li>

I come boldly to the throne of grace to receive my mercy and find grace for Your help in restoring my marriage.  I take my place, standing in the gap for my husband (wife) against the devil and his demons until the salvation of God is manifested in his (her) life.  Father, I have forgiven them of their sins and transgressions, just as You have forgiven me.  I stand firm knowing that he Holy Spirit will convict and convince him (her) of their sin, unrighteousness, and judgment.</p></li>
                  <p><span></span></p>
                  <li><p>Help me, Lord, to remain sane and sober-minded, temperate and disciplined because I love my husband (wife) and my children and I commit myself to them.  May I steadfastly remain self-controlled, chaste, good-natured and kind-hearted, adapting myself so the Word of God my not be exposed to reproach - blasphemed or discredited.</p></li>

I ask, Lord, that we be delivered from the spirit of rejection and accepted in the Beloved to be holy and blameless in His sight (Colossians 3:12-15).  Lord, I come humbly before You and ask that You heal this broken marriage as Jesus came to heal the brokenhearted.</p></li>
