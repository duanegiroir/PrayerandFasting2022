        <div class="content-text">
          <ul>
            <li><p>I am thankful for this day; for this is the day that You have made.  I will rejoice and be glad in it.  I am thankful for the Blood of Jesus, knowing it cleanses us from all unrighteousness (I John 1:9) and allows us to come boldly to the throne of grace (Hebrews 4:16).  I am thankful for the power in the Blood of Jesus to protect, cleanse, heal, deliver, sanctify, redeem, justify, and to make all things new.</p></li>
            <li><p>Heavenly Father, Your word says that whatsoever I shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever I loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven (Matthew 16:19).  In the Name of the Lord of Jesus Christ, I bind all evil, wicked, lying, unclean, tormenting, demonic spirits and strongman.  In the Name of Jesus, I bind them in our presence and I loose them to where He sends them.  I bind them and command them to stay here.</p></li>
            <li><p>I apply the Blood of Jesus over our homes (Exodus 12:7).  I apply the Blood of Jesus over every door and window of our homes.  I apply the Blood of Jesus over all the contents of our homes.  I apply the Blood of Jesus over all who enter in all who exit out of our homes.  Thank You, Lord, for our homes and the Blood of Jesus over them.</p></li>
            <li><p>I apply the Blood of Jesus over us as witnesses for You wherever we go - a city on the hill that can not be hid.  We will not hide our light under a bushel, but we will let our light shine before man that they may see our good works and glorify You, Heavenly Father.  We will give light to all those in our homes and our surroundings (Matthew 5:14-16).  Thank You, Lord, for our ministries and the Blood of Jesus over them.</p></li>
            <li><p>I apply the Blood of Jesus our our businesses and jobs.  I apply the Blood of Jesus over our finances and possessions.  I apply the Blood of Jesus over our bills, our checking accounts and savings, I apply the Blood of Jesus over all of our possessions and everything we will have.</p></li>

        <div class="content-text">
          <ul>
           <li><p>Heavenly Father, I ask that each of us will hear Your voice today for our families - that we will not be deceived in any area, that You will speak through us to our families, and that we will follow You and set a clear path for our families to follow You and set a clear path for our families to follow.  Let the words of our mouths and the meditation of our hearts be acceptable in Your sight for You are our strength and our redeemer.  Let our mouths speak wisdom and the meditation of our hearts be of understanding.  Let our speech always be with grace, seasoned with salt, that we will know how to answer every man.  Give us the tongue of the learned and lead us to speak a word to him that is weary in season.  Teach us to exhort one another today, lest any one of us be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.  Help us to never criticize, condemn, or complain because these are destructive weapons that kill, steal, and destroy.  They are weapons of the enemy.  Help us to abstain from all appearances of evil.</p></li>

        <h2 class="content-title">Wisdom and Knowledge</h2>
        <div class="content-text">
          <ul>
            <li><p>Heavenly Father, I ask that You give us knowledge of Your will in all wisdom adn spiritual understanding and the strength and might of You, to be involved in what You want us to be involved in, and not to be involved in the things You don't want us to be involved in.  Your Word says if any man lacks wisdom, let his ask You, and he will receive wisdom.  I as for wisdom in every decision we have to make today.  Help us to remember that our mind is a judge and we are always listening to fear and faith.  Fear produces substances of thins not hoped for, the evidence of the world's circumstances:  Evidence of things we can hear, see, smell, taste, and touch.  Faith produces substances of things hoped for, the evidence of thins from the Word of God ("This saith the Lord..."): things we cannot hear, see smell, touch, or taste.  These things are eternal.  From both of these reports, we choose to believe the report of the Lord.</p></li>

            <li><p>Father, in the name of Jesus and according to Your Word, I pray for the peace of Jersualem, that they may be saved.  I pray that You, Lord, will be a refuge and a stronghold to the children of Israel.  Father, Your Word says "multitudes are in the valley of decision" and whoever calls upon Your name shall be delivered and saved.  Have mercy upon Israel and be gracious to them, Lord, and take into consideration that they fight for their land to be restored.  You, Lord, are their strength and stronghold in their day of trouble.  We pray that they are righteous before You and that You will cause even their enemies to be at peace with them.  Father, as we intercede for Israel, we believe they will realize taht their defense adn shield depends on You.</p></li>
            <li><p>We thank you for Your Word and the covenant You have with the Jews ...that You will take away their sin.  We realize they have been disobedient and rebellious toward You, Lord.  We pray they will repent and recieve Your forgiveness.  We praise You for Your compassion.</p></li>
