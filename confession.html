              <ul>
                <li><p>Father, in the name of Jesus, I hold to Your Word as final authority in my life.  I will not consider the appearance of things - the adverse circumstances of the world - or evil reports.  I will follow the things of the spirit and not the things of the flesh.  My confidence is in Jeus!</p></li>
                <p><span></span></p>
                <li><p>My heart is fixed, established, confident in your provision and I refuse to be moved by anything that tries to exalt itself against your Word.</p></li>
                <p><span></span></p>
                <li><p>Jesus is Lord over my life - I refuse to waver.  He is Lord over spirit, body, and mind.  He is Lord of my finances.  I recognize His Lordship on a daily basis.</p></li>
                <p><span></span></p>
                <li><p>I can boldly and confidently say, "I have no lack,  I walk in abundance.  I am in safety and quiet from fear and evil.  I am healed.  I have wisdom.  The joy of the Lord is my strength.  Everything I put my hands to is a success in Jesus' Name."</p></li>
                <p><span></span></p>
                <li><p>I am committed to consider Jesus in every decision in my life - great or small.  I will follow after the Word of God and I refuse to compromise.</p></li>
                <p><span></span></p>
                <li><p>I give Jesus first place in my life.</p></li>

                <h4>1 Timothy 2:1-2 KJV</h4>
                <p>I exhort therefore, That first of all, <u>supplications</u>, <u>prayers</u>, <u>intercessions</u>, and giving of <u>thanks</u>, be made for all men.  For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.</p>
                <p><span></span></p>
                <h4>Matthew 21:22 KJV</h4>
                
                <p>And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.</p>
                <p><span></span></p>
                <h4>John 14:13-14 KJV</h4>
                
                <p>And whatsoever ye shall ask in My name, that will I do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.  If ye ask anything in My name, I will do it.</p>
                <p><span></span></p>
                <h4>John 16:23 KJV</h4>
                
                <p>And in that day ye shall ask me nothing.  Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in My name, He will give it to you.</p>
                <p><span></span></p>
                <h4>Matthew 18:18-20 KJV</h4>
                
                <p>Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven:  and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.  Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of My Father which is in heaven.  For where two or three are gathered together in MY NAME there am I in the midst of them.</p>
                <p><span></span></p>
                <h4>Jeremiah 1:12 KJV</h4>

                <h4>Psalms 103:20 KJV</h4>
                
                <p>Bless the Lord, ye HIS angels, that excel in strength, that do His commandments, hearkening unto the voice of His Word.</p>
                <p><span></span></p>
                <h4>Hebrews 10:23 KJV</h4>
                
                <p>Let us hold fast the profession (declare openly, confess) of our faith without wavering; for He is faithful that promised.</p>
