            <h2 class="content-title">Prayer for All Leaders</h2>
            <div class="content-text">
             <ul>
               <li><p>We pray and believe that no weapon formed against Faith Cathedral Leaders and their families prosper and that any tongue that rises against them in judgment shall be shown to be in the wrong.  Father, we plead the blood of Jesus Christ over leaders and their households and pray that Your angels of protection surround and protect them.  Thank You that none of their footsteps stumble.  Thank You that they walk in divine health and are satisfied with long lives. (Isaiah 54:17; Exodus 12:3-7, 13; Psalms 91:10-11; Hebrews 1:14; Proverbs 3:23; Proverbs 4:12; Deuteronomy 7:15; Psalms 91:16)</p></li>
               <p><span></span></p>
               <li><p>In the name of Jesus Christ, we rebuke, break and loose our leaders and their families from any and all evil curses, vexes, hexes, all physical powers, sorcery, witchcraft, psychic prayers which have been directed toward or put upon them or their families back to the generation of Adam and Eve on both sides of the family.  We bind every assignment of Satan directed toward them! (John 16;23; Matthew 18:8)</p></li>
               <p><span></span></p>
               <li><p>We, in faith, confess that all pastors of Faith Cathedral hold fast and follow the pattern of wholesome and sound teaching, in faith and love in Christ Jesus.  All pastors lovingly guard and keep the truth which has been entrusted to them by the Holy Spirit. (II Timothy 1:3; I Timothy 1:3-5, 11,12,14, 17-19; John 16:13)</p></li>
               <p><span></span></p>
               <li><p>Lord, we pray that each day freedom of utterance be given to pastors; that they speak boldly and courageously.  Thank You for strengthening them with might by Your Spirit that dwells in them.  Thank You that they walk by faith and not by sight and that You keep them in perfect peace because their minds are continually on You. (Ephesians 6:19; Jeremiah 1:17; Deuteromony 31:6; Ephesians 3:16; II Corinthians 5:7; Isaiah 26:3)</p></li>

        <h2 class="content-title">Prayer for the Bishop and the Senior Pastor</h2>
        <div class="content-text">
          <ul>
            <li><p>Father, in the name of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, we pray and confess that the Spirit of the Lord rests upon Bishop Drew and Pastor Wanda; the Sprirt of Wisdom and Understanding, the Spirit of Counsel and Might, the Spirit of Knowledge and the Spirit of Reverential Fear of the Lord. (John 15:16; Isaiah 11:2,3)</p></li>
            <p><span></span></p>
            <li><p>We pray that as your Spirit rests upon our Bishop and Senior Pastor, that it makes them quick in understanding because You have anointed and qualified them to preach the Gospel. (Isaiah 61:1-3; Like 4:18-19; Isaiah 11:3)</p></li>
            <p><span></span></p>
            <li><p>You have sent them to bind up and heal the brokenhearted; to proclaim liberty to spiritual, physical, and mental captives and the opening of prisons to those who are naturally and spiritually bound.  You have sent them to open the spiritual and natural eyes of those who are blind. (Luke 4:18-19; Isaiah 61:1)</p></li>
            <p><span></span></p>
            <li><p>Father, we GIVE YOU THANKS FOR God inspired visions that you have placed in their hearts and for providing everything needed to bring those visions into fruition.  We pray and give thanks that You are always supplying all of their needs and that they are blessed with the desires of their hearts.</p></li>
            <p><span></span></p>
            <li><p>Father, we pray and give thanks unto You for preparing Bishop and Senior Pastor's way; for leveling every mountain and every hill; for destroying every opposition of the enemy; for giving them treasures of darkness and hidden riches of secret places; for raising them up in righteousness and true holiness and for directing all of their ways. (Isaiah 45:2,3; Isaiah 61:8)</p></li>
            <p><span></span></p>
            <li><p>Father, we glorify You for the spirit of excellence that is upon Bishop and Senior Pastor for they do all things as unto the Lord.  WE give thanks that Your goodness and mercy follows in hot pursuit after them and that they daily grow in grace, daily grow in favor with You and with men, and daily grow in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. (Daniel 5:13; Daniel 6:3; I Corinthians 10:31; Colossians 3:17; Psalms 23:6; Proverbs 12:2; I Samuel 2:26; II Peter 3:18)</p></li>

          <li><p>Heavenly Father, we thank you that you have drawn this church family together to reflect Your heart.  We are a multi-racial family.</p></li>
          <p><span></span></p>
          <li><p>The enemy (devil) says it will not work and he has plans to divide us.</p></li>
          <p><span></span></p>
          <li><p>Heavenly Father, I pray in Jesus' Name and I ask that You rebuke any plans of the enemy to keep our church family from being together.</p></li>
          <p><span></span></p>
          <li><p>We know that satan comes to steal, kill, and destroy, but we stand firm and confident knowing that he has no power over You, Lord Jesus (John 10:10).</p></li>
          <p><span></span></p>
          <li><p>Thank You, Father, for hearing my prayer on behalf of the Faith Cathedral Family as we strive for the love of God to reign supreme and for the peace of God to act as umpire in all situations.</p></li>
          <p><span></span></p>
          <li><h4>As for me and my house, we will serve the Lord (Joshua 24:15).</h4> <P> May our church family know that You are Lord and that You watch over Your Word to perfome it, in Jesus' Name we pray. Amen!</p></li>
