            <li><p>My people, My people, My people - </p></li>
            <li><p>I call you mine because you are Mine indeed.  You are beginning to see how powerful <em><u>and</u></em> how needful your prayers are.</p></li>
            <p><span></span></p>
            <li><p>The world is filled with chaos and turmoil.  Oh, but I say I have not changed.  Nor have I changed my plans.  I have had a plan including your role in it since the foundation of the world.</p></li>
            <p><span></span></p>
            <li><p>I have filled your heart and your mind with My word, which is exceedingly Powerful</p></li>
            <p><span></span></p>
            <li><p>I placed you and your seed on this Earth <u><em>for such a time as this.</em></u></p></li>
            <p><span></span></p>
            <li><p>I now see many of you as Prayer Warriors.  You are fully equipped to <u>Bring Change</u>.  You will boldly proclaim My word.  Great testimonies shall come forth in 2019.  Souls will surrender as a result of your testimony.</p></li>
            <p><span></span></p>
            <li><p>Because of sincere hearts crying out to Me and sacrifice that has not gone unnoticed.  My heat is delighted to release the answers to cause the chains to break.</p></li>
            <p><span></span></p>
            <li><p>Tonight I am causing ungodly releationships to fall permanently.</p></li>
            <p><span></span></p>
            <li><p>Sons and daughters will return to their natural state and begin to worship Me.</p></li>
            <p><span></span></p>
            <li><p>Your prayers have formed a border.  The enemy can no longer seduce and rob adn steal from your seed because a border has been established through your prayer.</p></li>
            <p><span></span></p>
            <li><p>They will return as the Prodigal Son.  When they return, love them - for they are Mine!! - saith the Lord.</p></li>
